        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Preheat oven at low setting or 180 F. Combine flour, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Mix will be thick and will require use of hands to kneed the dough. Once mixed, place bowl in oven and continue.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Combine tomato paste, basil, salt, pepper, and small tomato in a seperate bowl. Mix until sauce is consistent. You may want to add more basil, salt, and pepper for taste. Make sure to break up tomato into smaller chunks for best sauce.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Sautee onion, pepper, mustrooms, and pepperoni in a skillet over medium heat with more olive oil for flavor. You may add salt, pepper, or other spices for added flavor. Pull mixture off direct heat before onions turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Pull crust from oven. It will be somewhat cooked or solid on the outside, this is fine. Kneed the crust until it has some elasticity and stretch over pan, rock, or serving tray while trying to keep dough as consistent as possible from the center to the edge. You may want to use cornmeal underneath the dough because it has a tendancy to stick to the pan once it is cooked.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Pour sauce on dough and evenly distribute as much as possible. Next, pour ingedients over dough and evenly distribute them. Mix all cheeses together in a bowl and hand-toss the cheese onto your pizza so that it covers the entire thing.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Preheat oven to 450 F (if your oven can get warmer take roughly 1 minute off of cooking time for each 50 degrees, i.e. at 550 F, cook for 8 minutes) and place pizza inside for 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown or cheese is bubbling throughout.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Remove from oven and serve. Note: pizza will be hot, hot, hot.</li>
